    "Decision trees are not new, but they are still widely used today. They are used to solve many machine learning problems, and can be combined to make powerful algorithms such as random forest and boosting. In this notebook, I want to explore some aspects around decision trees that we have not seen much in class: how to fight overfitting and how to handle incomplete datasets.\n",

For your sanity (and mine), I will not talk about those, but rather give you an overview of the methods and algorithms mentioned in the article.  "

    "Before diving into these methods, I will briefly introduce you to three common missingness patterns. I will not go into alot of detail, but it is important to know that it exists. Indeed, it is a very good practice to identify the missingness pattern of your data before chosing the way of dealing with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no relationship between the missingness of the data and any values, observed or missing. Missing values appear randomly in the dataset. It is a case that is rather rare in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing At Random (MAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a systemanic relationship between the tendancy of a value to be missing and the observed data (and not the missing data). This means that you can fully understand the missingness mechanism of a feature using features from which you have complete information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you imagine a dataset where each line contains information about someone (age, weight, earnings, and so on). If women are less likely to give their weight than men, then the 'weight' feature follows a MAR pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Missing At Random (NMAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a relationship between the tendancy of a value to be missing and its values. This means that the value of the variable that's missing is related to the reason it's missing. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous dataset, people with low earnings might be less likely to share their earnings out of shame. \n",

It is an easy way to deal with missing data, but you way lose some information depending on the amount of data that is discarded.

    "\n",
    "All features that contain missing data are deleted. This obviously is quite a limited method, but can be useful if you have datasets with some features having the majority of the missing values (for example, if people don't like to share their drug consumption, just discard the column). Complete variable can be used on the test set, as you are free to chose the features you want to use to make your prediction. \n",

Pruning consists in reducing the size of a tree by either stopping it from growing too much, either by cutting out the less relevent leaves. \n",
